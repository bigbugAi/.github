# 🧠 BigBugAI

**BigBugAI** is an AI systems organization focused on building **intelligent models that reason, learn, and act** in real-world financial environments.

We build both **production-grade proprietary models** and **high-quality open-source foundations**, with a clear separation between monetized intelligence and community-driven research.

Our work spans:
- Financial reasoning & market intelligence
- Agent-based systems with memory and autonomy
- Open-source AI foundations for extensibility
- Scalable, deployable AI infrastructure

## 🚀 What We Build

### 🔒 Proprietary / Production Models
These models power BigBugAI’s paid products and internal systems.

- **BigBugAI Nemotron-Fin**  
  Financial reasoning and prediction model designed for market inference, confidence-weighted signals, and narrative-aware analysis.

- **AlphaCore Engine**  
  Strategy aggregation and signal intelligence engine used for validation, backtesting-aware inference, and risk-adjusted decision making.

> These repositories are private and used in production systems.

### 🔓 Open-Source Foundations

#### 🧠 BugForge
**BugForge** is BigBugAI’s open-source model foundation — designed to be forked, extended, and deployed.

Apache 2.0 licensed.

Repositories include:
- `bugforge-core` — shared model primitives
- `bugforge-fin` — open financial intelligence models
- `bugforge-agent` — agent reasoning & orchestration
- `bugforge-memory` — memory & embedding pipelines
- `bugforge-robot` — embodied / robotics intelligence

BugForge focuses on **clarity, extensibility, and real-world usability**, not demos.

### 🪶 Lightweight / Experimental Models
Developer-first, easy-to-adopt models intended for experimentation and learning.

- `openbug-signal`
- `openbug-agent`

MIT licensed.

## 🧩 Platforms & Infrastructure

- **BigBugAI Analytics Portal** — subscription-based crypto analytics
- **Autonomous Social Agents** — X / Farcaster intelligence agents
- **BotTensor** — agent communication & intelligence layer (MCP-based)
- **APIs & Runners** — schedulers, inference services, and data pipelines

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Systems first, features second  
- AI as a component, not magic  
- Clear separation of open vs proprietary intelligence  
- Built for deployment, not just research  
- Long-term leverage over short-term hype
